    ## â›… Climate Data Assessment & Temperature Prediction System for Nepal
    
    ##### Part of assignment under Capstone Project of Omdena's & NIC Capacity Building Batch II-Group B.
    
    ###### The purpose of assignment is to create a data analysis system that monitors, analyzes, and predicts maximum Temperature in Nepal with a focus on vulnerable regions. This application helps **analyze climate data and predict maximum temperatures** based on various environmental and agricultural factors and is developed by Om Nepali.

    #### ðŸŒŸ Overview:
    - **Objective**: Predict maximum temperatures for nepal based on historical climate and agricultural data
    - **Target Variable**: Average Maximum Temperature (`avg_max_temp`)
    - **Included Features**: Temperature Metrics, Humidity, Precipitation, Population density, Agricultural Land Area, etc,
    - **Involves**:
        - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        - Feature Engineering
        - Machine Learning Modeling
        - Natural Language Processing
